## DATA TYPES
 1. **int**: Integer type, used for whole numbers.
    2. **float**: Floating-point type, used for decimal numbers.
    3. **str**: String type, used for text.
    4. **bool**: Boolean type, used for True/False values.
    5. **list**: List type, used for ordered collections of items.
    6. **tuple**: Tuple type, used for ordered, immutable collections of items.
    7. **dict**: Dictionary type, used for key-value pairs.
    8. **set**: Set type, used for unordered collections of unique items.
    9. **NoneType**: Represents the absence of a value or a null value.
 10. **bytes**: Immutable sequence of bytes, used for binary data.
 11. **bytearray**: Mutable sequence of bytes, used for binary data.
 12. **memoryview**: A view object that exposes the buffer interface for byte data.
 13. **complex**: Complex number type, used for complex numbers with real and imaginary parts.
 14. **frozenset**: Immutable version of a set, used for unordered collections of unique items.
 15. **range**: Represents an immutable sequence of numbers, commonly used in loops.
 16. **object**: The base class for all classes in Python, used for creating user-defined classes.
 17. **slice**: Represents a slice object, used for slicing sequences.
 18. **Ellipsis**: Represents the ellipsis object, used in advanced indexing and slicing.   
    19. **NotImplemented**: A singleton object used to indicate that an operation is not implemented for a specific type.
    20. **type**: Represents the type of an object, used for type checking and introspection.

## OPERATORS
    1. **Arithmetic operators- used for mathematical operations.
        1. **Addition (+)**: Adds two numbers.
        2. **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts one number from another.
        3. **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies two numbers.
        4. **Division (/)**: Divides one number by another (returns float).
        5. **Floor Division (//)**: Divides one number by another and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result.
        6. **Modulus (%)**: Returns the remainder of a division operation.
        7. **Exponentiation (**)**: Raises one number to the power of another.
    2. **Comparison operators- used to compare two values.
        1. **Equal (==)**: Checks if two values are equal.
        2. **Not Equal (!=)**: Checks if two values are not equal.
        3. **Greater Than (>)**: Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.
        4. **Less Than (<)**: Checks if the left value is less than the right value.
        5. **Greater Than or Equal To (>=)**: Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.
        6. **Less Than or Equal To (<=)**: Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.  
    3. **Logical operators- used to combine conditional statements.
        1. **And**: Returns True if both statements are true.
        2. **Or**: Returns True if at least one of the statements is true.
        3. **Not**: Reverses the result of a condition (True becomes False and vice versa).
    4. **Assignment operators- used to assign values to variables.
        1. **Assignment (=)**: Assigns a value to a variable.
        2. **Add and Assign (+=)**: Adds a value to a variable and assigns the result to that variable.
        3. **Subtract and Assign (-=)**: Subtracts a value from a variable and assigns the result to that variable.
        4. **Multiply and Assign (*=)**: Multiplies a variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
        5. **Divide and Assign (/=)**: Divides a variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
        6. **Floor Divide and Assign (//=)**: Performs floor division on a variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
        7. **Modulus and Assign (%=)**: Takes the modulus of a variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
        8. **Exponentiate and Assign (**=)**: Raises a variable to the power of a value and assigns the result to that variable.
