14. **frozenset**: Immutable version of a set, used for unordered collections of unique items.
15. **range**: Represents an immutable sequence of numbers, commonly used in loops.
16. **object**: The base class for all classes in Python, used for creating user-defined classes.
17. **slice**: Represents a slice object, used for slicing sequences.
18. **Ellipsis**: Represents the ellipsis object, used in advanced indexing and slicing.   
19. **NotImplemented**: A singleton object used to indicate that an operation is not implemented for a specific type.
20. **type**: Represents the type of an object, used for type checking and introspection.

## OPERATORS
# 1. **Arithmetic operators- used for mathematical operations.
1. **Addition (+)**: Adds two numbers.
2. **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts one number from another.
3. **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies two numbers.
4. **Division (/)**: Divides one number by another (returns float).
5. **Floor Division (//)**: Divides one number by another and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result.
6. **Modulus (%)**: Returns the remainder of a division operation.
7. **Exponentiation (**)**: Raises one number to the power of another.

# 2. **Comparison operators- used to compare two values.
1. **Equal (==)**: Checks if two values are equal.
2. **Not Equal (!=)**: Checks if two values are not equal.
3. **Greater Than (>)**: Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.
4. **Less Than (<)**: Checks if the left value is less than the right value.
5. **Greater Than or Equal To (>=)**: Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.
6. **Less Than or Equal To (<=)**: Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value. 

# 3. **Logical operators- used to combine conditional statements.
1. **And**: Returns True if both statements are true.
2. **Or**: Returns True if at least one of the statements is true.
3. **Not**: Reverses the result of a condition (True becomes False and vice versa).

# 4. **Assignment operators- used to assign values to variables.
1. **Assignment (=)**: Assigns a value to a variable.
2. **Add and Assign (+=)**: Adds a value to a variable and assigns the result to that variable.
3. **Subtract and Assign (-=)**: Subtracts a value from a variable and assigns the result to that variable.
4. **Multiply and Assign (*=)**: Multiplies a variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
5. **Divide and Assign (/=)**: Divides a variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
6. **Floor Divide and Assign (//=)**: Performs floor division on a variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
7. **Modulus and Assign (%=)**: Takes the modulus of a variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
8. **Exponentiate and Assign (**=)**: Raises a variable to the power of a value and assigns the result to that variable.



# 5. **Identity operators- used to compare the memory locations of two objects.
1. **Is**: Returns True if both variables point to the same object.
2. **Is Not**: Returns True if both variables do not point to the same object.

# 6. **Membership operators- used to test if a value is present in a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string).
1. **In**: Returns True if a value is found in the sequence.
2. **Not In**: Returns True if a value is not found in the sequence.

# 7. **Bitwise operators- used to perform bit-level operations on integers.
1. **Bitwise AND (&)**: Performs a bitwise AND operation on two integers.
2. **Bitwise OR (|)**: Performs a bitwise OR operation on two integers.
3. **Bitwise XOR (^)**: Performs a bitwise XOR operation on two integers.
4. **Bitwise NOT (~)**: Inverts the bits of an integer.
5. **Left Shift (<<)**: Shifts the bits of an integer to the left by a specified number of positions.
6. **Right Shift (>>)**: Shifts the bits of an integer to the right by a specified number of positions.
